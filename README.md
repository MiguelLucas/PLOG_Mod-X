# PLOG_Mod-X

This project is my application of the Mod-X board game (https://www.cryptozoic.com/games/mod-x) in Prolog. It is complete with all functionalities, including options to change number of pieces per player, number of points to be achieved and different modes. It includes a Player vs Player mode, a Player vs Computer mode and a Computer vs Computer mode.

There are 2 dificulties in the game with diferent levels of artificial intelligence (one easier, other harder). The first one will try its best to score as quickly as possible. The second one will do this, while at the same time will try to destroy your chances of scoring.
